			VERSION 0.6 April 1990

This file gives brief notes on changes, fixes, and enhancements
included in this version (0.6) that are not included in previously
released versions.

***************************************************************************

>>> INSTALLATION FIXES <<<

(1)	The "make clean" and "make reallyclean" directives should work
	from the top-level in this version (0.6).
	(Bruce Cohen, bruce@orca.wv.tek.com)

(2)	The macro "NYTABCFIX" is passed to lower-level makefiles in
	this version (0.6).
	(Bruce Cohen, bruce@orca.wv.tek.com)

(3)	Name of NewYacc library to use in building examples is passed
	down to low-level makefiles in this version (0.6).
	(Bruce Cohen, bruce@orca.wv.tek.com)

>>> NEWYACC FIXES <<<

(4)	Name conflicts are totally isolated in this version (0.6).
	Avoid use of names with prefixes "ny_" and "yy" since thay are
	internally defined.

(5)	The variable "yylineno" is defined consistently in the fix
	scripts, nytabcfix.yacc, nytabcfix.byacc, and nylexfix.lex.

(6)	NewYacc accepts literals in single and double quotes in this
	version (0.6).

(7)	NewYacc accepts the literal '\'' in this version (0.6).

(8)	NewYacc accepts "^L" characters in the input file in this
	version (0.6).

(9)	An obscure bug was fixed in the implementation of the
	IF...THEN and IF...THEN...ELSE statements.  The else branch
	was not being initialized to NIL in the former.  When memory
	got reused, a segmentation fault would occur.

(10)	Variable assignment semantics are now BY-VALUE instead of
	BY-REFERENCE in this version (0.6).  Assignments were simple
	pointer reassignments before, but this has been changed.

(11)	Debugging is improved.  The yyerror routine was redefined to
	be more useful.
	(Stephen Adams, sra%ecs.southhampton.ac.uk@NSFnet-Relay.AC.UK)

(12)	A reference assignment problem is fixed in this version (0.6)
	(e.g., @x=@y would fail).

(13)	A reference argument problem is fixed in this version (0.6)
	(e.g., foo(@x) would fail).

(14)	A problem with the use of some user-defined functions is fixed
	in this version (0.6).

>>> TRIVIAL FIXES <<<

(15)	The usage message for newyacc reads "newyacc" not "nyacc" in
	this version (0.6).
	(Bruce Cohen, bruce@orca.wv.tek.com)

(16)	The usage message for the calc examples reads correctly in
	this version (0.6).
	(Bruce Cohen, bruce@orca.wv.tek.com)
