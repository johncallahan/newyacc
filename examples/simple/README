This is my test example for the line number and character within
line positioning functions built into NewYacc for the Cinema tool.

Sample input string can be found in files "samplestring1" and
"samplestring2" and demonstrate the following features:

	starting line
	starting character within line
	ending line
	ending character within line

as 4-tuples after tokens in the parsed strings.  After making the
executables,  you can run the tool on data in files "samplestring1"
or "samplestring2"

Stripped of newyacc translations, the language is essentially 

	alist	:	C
		|	D A alist B
		|	E A alist B
		|	other A alist B

	other	:  /* empty */
		|	F
		|	G
