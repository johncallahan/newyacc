These annotations list rules and translations found in newyacc
source files.  For example, the file "newyacc.ny" can itself be
piped through the lister programs called "listtrans" and "listrules".
If you want to know how many translations you have in a grammar
then you can run

	listtrans < yourfile.ny | wc -l

Ditto for "listrules" ...
